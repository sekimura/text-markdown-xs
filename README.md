NOTE
====

Originally, I was working on Text::Markdown::XS, a bridge for
Discount: an implementation of markdown in C by David Parsons.

But, since I've found another C implementation, peg-markdown
written by John MacFarlane, I decided to create two perl modules
for each implementations.

You can get Text::Markdown::Discount at

  http://github.com/sekimura/text-markdown-discount/tree/master

and Text::Markdown::PegMarkdown at

  http://github.com/sekimura/text-markdown-pegmarkdown/tree/master
